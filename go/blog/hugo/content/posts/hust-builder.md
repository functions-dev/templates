## The Host Builder
We have introduced the Host Builder (currently in active developement) some months
ago and its already been available behind a flag *FUNC_ENABLE_HOST_BUILDER* which
needs to be set to truthy value in order to use it.

# Why use it?
It's way faster to build your Functions!. Func will package your Functions
directory as an archive in a specific way into an image ready to be 'run'
locally on your machine, within seconds!

## Building example
